# 💳 Transact-Ease
# 📘 Project Documentation — *Transact-Ease*

---

## 1. 📖 **Project Overview**

* **Name:** Transact-Ease
* **Type:** Web API (Banking/Transaction/Remittance System)
* **Purpose:** Enable secure, controlled, and trackable transactions between users and organizations through cards, mobile apps, or counters. Supports cashback/membership schemes and strict audit requirements.

---

## 2. ⚙️ **Technical Requirements**

* **Backend:** ASP.NET Core Web API
* **Frontend (optional):** Angular (for admin panel)
* **Database:** PostgreSQL
* **Cache Layer:** Redis (for speed/rate-limiting)
* **Auth:** JWT + Role-based access
* **Containerization:** Docker / Docker Compose
* **Deployment:** Google Cloud (or local/staging first)
* **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions or GitLab CI

---

## 3. 🏗️ **System Architecture**

### 📌 Core Principles:

* **Modular Monolith** (can migrate to microservices later)
* **Hierarchical organization model** (org → branch → counter)
* **Accounts** can belong to users *or* organizations
* **Access restriction**: users/orgs can only see their own and parent-level data
* **Multi-channel support**: card, app, counter, device

### 🧱 Architecture Modules:

* Auth Module
* Organization Tree & Role Manager
* Accounts & Wallets
* Transactions & Cashback Engine
* Access Points / Device Interface
* Audit Logging
* Reporting Layer

## 4. 📑 **API Documentation Structure**

Written in OpenAPI/Swagger style — organized by modules:

| Group             | Example Endpoint                         |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Auth**          | `POST /api/auth/login`, `GET /me`        |
| **Users**         | `POST /api/users`, `GET /api/users/:id`  |
| **Organizations** | `POST /api/organizations`                |
| **Accounts**      | `GET /api/accounts/me`                   |
| **Transactions**  | `POST /api/transactions`, `GET /history` |
| **Cashback**      | `POST /api/cashback-schemes`             |
| **Reports**       | `GET /api/reports/summary`               |
| **Logs**          | `GET /api/audit-logs`                    |

## 5. 🧬 **Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)**

Core Entities:

* `users` → linked to `organizations` and `roles`
* `accounts` → owned by `users` or `organizations`
* `transactions` → from one account to another
* `cashback_schemes` → created by organizations
* `access_points` → where transactions occur
* `audit_logs` → record every action

👉 You already have this in [dbdiagram.io DSL format](#) (generated earlier)

## 6. 🔁 **Transaction Flow Diagrams**

* **User sends money → transaction record → cashback evaluation → log update**
* **Organization receives → balance updated → optional cashback applied**
* **Access point records transaction location/device info**
* All steps log to the audit trail

## 7. 🧾 **Logging & Reporting Standards**

### ✅ Audit Logging:

* Every user action (transaction, role change, cashback update)
* Includes: `timestamp`, `user_id`, `org_id`, `action`, `details`

### 📊 Reports:

* Per-user and per-org transaction summaries
* Cashback totals over time
* Active vs. failed transaction metrics
* Download/export to CSV/PDF

| Phase   | Milestone                                  |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Phase 1 | Core auth, org setup, account creation     |
| Phase 2 | Basic transactions + audit logs            |
| Phase 3 | Cashback rule engine + device registration |
| Phase 4 | Reports & dashboard API                    |
| Phase 5 | Optional admin panel UI                    |

## 9. 🔐 **Authentication / Authorization Strategy**

* **Auth Method:** JWT Token (Bearer Token)
* **Roles:**

  * `BankAdmin`
  * `BranchManager`
  * `AccessOperator`
  * `Customer`
* **Permissions:**

  * Based on role + organization tree
  * No lateral access to sibling orgs
  * All transactions tied to both user and device (for traceability)
