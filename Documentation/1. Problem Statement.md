## ðŸ“„ Problem Statement

* Many banks, remittance centers, and money transfer services work through a network of branches, agents, and local counters. These systems are often difficult to manage, especially when it comes to controlling who can see what information.

* Staff and users need access to only their own data and their direct team or supervisors. But current systems often donâ€™t allow this properly. Some people get too much access, others not enough.

* Businesses like stores or service counters also want to offer money transfer services or accept payments. Sometimes they want to reward customers with cashback or bonuses based on how much they spend or other special offersâ€”but current systems make this complicated.

* People use different ways to send and receive money: mobile apps, cards, websites, or going directly to counters. All of these should work in the same way, but many systems treat them differently, leading to confusion.

* Transactions should be clearly recorded so that anyone (user or admin) can see what happened and when. Support teams and auditors often struggle to get clear and simple reports from existing systems.

* Because of all this, organizations spend a lot of time manually checking transactions, solving user problems, and trying to make their systems work together.
